# The CareChanger Web Platform

A Heroku web app running Django with a PostgreSQL backend. The CareChanger platform connects a live-feed of medical data from wifi-connected microcontrollers to a private caregroup database. This data powers patient status graphs, as well as an event-driven alert system.

This web framework was designed and built by Ross, Kelvin, and Misha of the University of Victoria Biomedical Club.
